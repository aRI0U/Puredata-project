# Puredata project

This repository contains the work I realized for a [Puredata](https://puredata.info/) at master ATIAM, supervized by Ninon Devis.

## Repository organization

The main patch is written in `main.pd`. An audio performance produced with this script is given in `audio.wav`. Other patches are written within several subfolders:
- `effects/` contains audio effects
- `utils/` contains several utilities
- `patches/` contains other patches used within `main.pd`
- `misc/`contains other patches that arefinally not used

## TODOs

- record audio
- add comments
- clean canvas
